Yes ✅ — your **webcam can capture the LED light** if:

---

### ✅ **Conditions:**

1. **Room is dark or low light** ➜ LED will stand out clearly.
2. **LED is bright** enough (not diffused or blocked).
3. Webcam has decent frame rate (30 fps or more is ideal).

---

### 🔍 How it works:

* Webcam sees the **bright spot** (LED).
* OpenCV finds **white/bright pixels** using threshold.
* Tracks its (x, y) **position frame by frame**.
* Draws the **trail/path** on screen.

---

### 🧪 Test:

1. Turn off room lights.
2. Point webcam at LED.
3. Move LED slowly.
4. Use the code I gave — it will show motion trace.
